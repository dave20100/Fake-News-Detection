abstract = "Automatic error-correction m natural language processing is based on the principle of “elastic matching”. Text words are segmented into “lines” with letters arranged according to a pre-determined sequence, and then matched line-by-line, shifts being applied if the numbers of lines are unequal. In order to resolve the possible multiple choices produced, the method may be supplemented by another one, based on the observed repetition of words in natural texts, and also by syntactic analysis. This paper describes the above methods and gives an account of an experiment now in progress at the National Physical Laboratory."

@article{Yoshinaga1999,
	abstract = {We propose a new information retriever on the Web which: automatically classifies collected documents; and retrieves multi-lingual information (e.g., Japanese and/or English). This is attained by the mechanism of ontology processing. We set up a multi-lingual ontology as an index dictionary. The ontology manages the relations of keywords and the weights of keywords for domain categories to classify the documents. The system has the following features: users can use any keywords expressed in their native language to search for the Web documents, even if they contain multi lingual information; and the documents can be classified into specific domain categories by tuning the keyword weights up},

@article{Chawla2008,
	abstract = {Web is a valuable source of information and it is expanding at an enormous speed. Search engines provide the interface to access to this vast pool of information. Users express their information need through the input query to retrieve the relevant information which does not prove to be effective as input query entered by the user is too short to get the information need of the user. To retrieve the information according to a particular information need from a big pool of information available on the web is a big challenge. This paper proposes a method to find the related queries which approximate the information need of the input query issued to the search engine. This is accomplished using Information scent and content of clicked pages in query sessions mining. Information scent is derived from the information foraging theory in which user behavior in the information environment is guided by information scent. Information need of the query sessions is modeled using information scent and content of clicked URLs and query sessions with similar information need are clustered. The clusters which closely approximate the information need of input query are used to suggest queries with similar information need for a given input query. The suggested queries are ranked in order of their degree of relevance with respect to information need of the input query. Retrieval precision of search engine is improved as suggested queries help to retrieve document relevant to the need of user efficiently and quickly. Experimental study has been conducted on the dataset collected from "Google" search engine Web history to confirm the improvement of precision of information retrieval.},
